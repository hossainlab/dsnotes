# Introduction to Python

## What is Python? 
- Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
- Python's design philosophy emphasizes code **readability** with its notable use of significant whitespace

## Key Points 
- Designed by: [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum)
- Typing discipline: Duck, dynamic, gradual
- Stable release: 3.8.2 / 24 February 2020; 25 days ago
- Preview release: 3.9.0a4 / 26 February 2020; 23 days ago
- Paradigm: Multi-paradigm: functional, imperative, object-oriented, reflective

## Why Python? 
- Python Is Free and Open-Source
- Python Is Popular, Loved, and Wanted
- Python Has a Friendly and Devoted Community
- Python Has Elegant and Concise Syntax
- Python Is Multi-Platform
- Python Supports Multiple Programming Paradigms 
- Python Offers Useful Built-In Libraries
- Python Has Many Third-Party Packages
- Python Is a General-Purpose Programming Language
- Python Plays Nice with Others

## Why Python Rocks for Research? 
- Holistic Language Design
- Readability
- Balance of High Level and Low Level Programming
- Language Interoperability
- Documentation System
- Hierarchical Module System

## Getting Started

### Printing Message

print("Hello World!")

### Python as a Calculator

2+2 

3 - 2

3 * 2 

6 / 2

3 * 2 + 5 

### Variables 
- What is Variables?
- Creating / Declaration of Variables 
- Naming Conventions 
- Restrictions / Reserved Words / Identifiers 

a = 10 
print(a)

b = 10.5 
print(b)

type(b)

print(a)

b = 10.5 
print(b)

print(a)

name = "abul"
print(name)

type(name)

myName = "Jubayer"
my_name = "Jubayer"
sayHello = "Hello"

import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)

False = "Sammo"

as = "Student"

class = "11"

import = "this"

### Statements
Instructions that a Python interpreter can execute are called statements. For example, `a = 1` is an assignment statement. 

a = 10 
b = 10.5 
name = "Sammo"

### Comments

# Print Hello 
print("Hello")

### Data Types
Data is the collection of facts! data cen be anything like numbers, audio, images, video, text, papers. 

- Integers(int)
- Floating Point(float) 
- Complex(j) 
- Strings 


#### Integers

x = 10 

type(x)

y = 5.5 

type(y)

c = 2 + 6j 

type(c)

my_name = "Jubayer"

type(my_name)

name = 'abul'

type(name)
